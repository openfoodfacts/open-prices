## ðŸŽ¨ Design & User interface
- The Open Prices server is exposed through the Mobile App and the Open Prices frontend (and probably elsewhere in the future, thanks to web components)
- We strive to thoughtfully design every feature before we move on to implementation, so that we respect Open Food Facts' graphic charter and nascent design system, while having efficient user flows.
