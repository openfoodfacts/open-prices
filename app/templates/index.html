                            Prices?</h2>
                        <p>Open Prices is a project to collect and share prices of food
                            products around the world. It’s a publicly available dataset
                            that can be used for research, analysis, and more. Open
                            Prices is developed and maintained by <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a>.</p>
                        <p>At present, historical prices of food products are owned by a
                            few companies that sell them to private companies,
                            researchers or other organizations and are not freely
                            accessible. This project aims to change that, by mobilizing
                            people everywhere to share the prices they see in their
                            local shops.</p>
                        <h2 class="emphasized-title" id="how-does-open-prices-work">How
                            does Open Prices work?</h2>
                        <p>We’re crowdsourcing an open-source dataset of food prices.
                            Prices can be added by retailers or hackers through <a
                                href="https://prices.openfoodfacts.org/docs">our API</a>.
                            A web and mobile app is in the works to make it easier for
                            people to add prices.</p>
                        <p>Open Prices is not only meant to store individual prices, but
                            consumption baskets, i.e. the list of products that people
                            buy in a single shopping trip. This data is extremely
                            interesting for researchers to analyze food consumption
                            habits.</p>
                        <p>When possible, we ask contributors to always provide a proof
                            of the price, in the form of a photo of the price tag or
                            receipt. This is to ensure the quality of the data and to
                            make it easier to ensure data quality.</p>
                        <p>If you’re providing a receipt as the proof image, it means
                            you agree to submit your consumption basket to Open Prices.
                            We will anonymize the receipt and make it publicly
                            available, so that it can be used for research purpose. If
                            you don’t want to publicly share your receipt, you can still
                            contribute by taking a picture of the price tag.</p>
