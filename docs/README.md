# Open Prices

Open Prices is a project to collect and share prices of food products around the world. To learn more about the project, please visit [prices.openfoodfacts.org](https://prices.openfoodfacts.org/).

It consists of:

- a REST API, built using Django (repo: [`open-prices`](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/open-prices))
- a [web interface](https://prices.openfoodfacts.org), built using Vue.js (repo: [`open-prices-frontend`](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/open-prices-frontend))

If you're a contributor, have a look at our tutorials to add a [single](add-a-price.md) or [multiple](add-multiple-prices.md) prices!
