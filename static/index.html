                            Prices?</h2>
                        <p>Open Prices is a project to collect and share prices of food
                            products around the world. It’s a publicly available dataset
                            that can be used for research, analysis, and more. Open
                            Prices is developed and maintained by <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a>.</p>
                        <p>There are currently few companies that own large databases of product prices
                            at the barcode level. These prices are not freely available, but sold at a high price to
                            private actors, researchers and other organizations that can afford them.</p>
                        <h2 class="emphasized-title" id="how-does-open-prices-work">How
                            does Open Prices work?</h2>
                        <p>We are crowdsourcing an open-source dataset of food prices.
                            Prices can be added by users through our <a href="/app/">web app</a>.
                            Retailers or third-party apps can contribute as well by using <a
                                href="/api/docs">our API</a>.
                            A mobile app is in the works and will be available soon.</p>
                        <p>Open Prices is not only meant to store individual prices, but also
                            consumption baskets, i.e. the list of products that people
                            buy in a single shopping trip. This data is extremely
                            interesting for researchers to analyze food consumption
                            habits.</p>
                        <p>When possible, we ask contributors to provide a proof
                            of the price, in the form of a photo of the price tag or
                            receipt. This is to make it easier to ensure data quality.</p>
                        <p>If you are providing a receipt as the proof image, it means
                            you agree to submit your consumption basket to Open Prices.
                            We will anonymize the receipt and make it publicly
                            available, so that it can be used for research purpose. If
                            you don’t want to publicly share your receipt, you can still
                            contribute by taking a picture of the price tag.</p>

                            prices from retailers’ websites as a valid way to
                            contribute
                            to Open Prices. We want to make sure that the prices we
                            collect are accurate and up-to-date, and receiving
                            scraped
                            prices from contributors doesn’t allow us to do that.</p>
                        <p>Price scraping is a considered option in a future version
                            of
                            Open Prices, but it would be done by Open Prices itself
                            so
                            that we can have a proof of the price based on the
                            HTML
                            page.</p>
